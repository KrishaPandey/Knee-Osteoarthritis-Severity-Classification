# Knee-Osteoarthritis-Severity-Classification

# Overview

Koa Severity Classification System is application to classify the severity of Knee Osteoarthritis . The project integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, a React.js frontend for user interaction, and a Django backend to manage the server-side processing and API endpoints.

# Features

Image Upload: Users can upload images for severity classification.
Real-time Results: Instant feedback on the severity level predicted by the model.
RESTful Backend: Powered by Django to handle API requests and manage classification workflows.
Deep Learning Model: CNN for high-accuracy image classification.

# Technologies Used

Frontend: React.js
Responsive UI for user interaction and image upload.

Backend: Django
REST API for communication between frontend and model.

Machine Learning Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
